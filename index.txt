the significance of the meta charset utf-8 is as follows:
It helps web browsers understand and display text in different languages, like English, Chinese, or Arabic, without getting mixed up or showing strange symbols.
It ensures that special characters, like emojis or currency symbols, show up correctly on websites, so you can see things like smiley faces or dollar signs just as they were meant to be.
It's like a set of instructions for web browsers, telling them how to properly show the text and symbols on a webpage, so everything looks neat and readable, no matter what language or characters are used.
 It's widely accepted by all modern web browsers, so web designers use it to make sure their websites look good and work well for everyone, no matter which browser or device they're using.

In short, `<meta charset="UTF-8">` helps websites speak many languages, display special characters correctly, and look good on any device.
